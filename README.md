Project based on the forecasting of the dataset [Daily Climate time series data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data) available at Kaggle.

Our approach will consider statistical timeseries methods, such as ARIMA or Holt-Winters Smoothing, but also ML techniques as Linear Regression.
Furthermore, we will later on explore recent Deep Learning techniques such as RNNs and LSTMs, as well as the famous Prophet Facebook library.
